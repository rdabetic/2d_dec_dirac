# 2D Discrete Exterior Calculus for the Dirac Operator
This is a small library to solve BVPs with homogenous Dirichlet boundary conditions involving the Dirac operator in 2D using multigrid. To run some convergence tests, run `runme.sh`.
Required external dependencies:
    - Eigen (3.4)
    - MFEM (4.8)
